# 02180_AI

The purpose of this algorithm is to create an AI algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree search in order to beat 2048.

The AI part is the function "find_next_move" in the call Board in the file board.py. The rest of the code is just the game implementation.


To run the code, go to the main directory and write in your terminal "python main.py".
